        <div id="texto">
            <p>
                Remember that i'm studying japanese? So, the school i got a one year scholarship is a "language and culture school". 
                I'm currently on the sewing club (were sewing a happi, will post about it sometime later) and sometimes we have a culinary class. 
                I beg for the cooking gods' forgiveness cuz i suck at plate presentation. (also at taking pictures but that's another story)<br>
                <br>
                Last time (that i didn't post) we made gyōza, harusame salad and miso soup <br>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/receitaG.webp" alt="">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/gyouza.webp" alt="">
                </div>
                This time we made takoyaki, onigiri and yakitori. <br>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/receita1.webp" alt="">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/receita2.webp" alt="">
                </div>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/prato2.webp" alt="">
                </div>
                <br>
                <h3>Getting ready</h3>
                First we did the takoyaki and yakitori sauces. <br>
                Since we were in 12, i had to count <strong>50</strong> spoonfuls of shōyu, plus 30 of sugar and 10 of sake (the cooking one). 
                Then we boiled the sake to get the alcohol out, then added the shōyu and sugar. <br>
                After it started to grow we took it off the stove and lowered the heat to put it again. 
                Since we don't have a centennial tare, we just took out a bit of the foam. <br>
                (I didn't see the takoyaki sauce being made so i can't describe it's recipe :/) <br>
                <br>
                Then we got to cut the chicken breast. <br>
                First take the skin bits out, then cut off the most thick edge, and last but not least cut in half the remaining breast. 
                The thin part of these two halves will be in the end of the stick, so when cutting the three parts in bite-sized bits make sure to split them. 
                At the same time other people where cutting the green onion for both the takoyaki and yakitori, thinly for the first and long for the other.
                <br><br>
                <br>
                <h3>Putting it together</h3>
                For the takoyaki dough you will need eggs, flour, water and the green onions (we also put some teeny tiny shrimpies but i <i>think</i> that is optional?). <br>
                Mix first the water and eggs, then slowly add the flour while mixing, and lastly the green onions and shrimps. <br>
                After this, cut the octopus in tiny bits that will fit in a takoyaki ball (something around half to one centimeter i think)<br>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/takoyaki1.webp" alt="">
                </div>
                <br>
                For the yakitori we measured 4~5 fingers before the round edge of the stick to have where to grasp.
                Then, in the same direction the chicken's fibers go, we pierced it. It is quite simple, first one of the thick chicken bits then a green onion, and repeat.
                When getting close to the sharp tip (around 2 fingers), you put one of the thin chicken cut, but since it is thin you put it folded. <br>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/yakitori1.webp" alt="">
                </div>
                <br>
                The rice for the onigiri is the easiest, since the teacher got an electric rice cooker. <br>
                A handful of rice is enough, so put this much in a bowl using a spoon. 
                Then wet your hands with water and get some salt on those hands. <br>
                Now take the rice and start shaping it with your hands. If you want a filling, put it in the middle before shaping. <br>
                To shape, basically make a triangle with each of your hands. The upper one sideways and the lower one pointed fowards. Then press and spin. <br>
                And you're done! If you want, put some furikake or a nori on it. <br> 
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 33%;" src="/images/culinaria/onigiri.webp" alt="">
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>"Yaki-ing 'em Ts"</h3>
                We were in groups, and mine was the first in the onigiri (result above). <br>
                After that we went to the takoyaki machine.
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%; align-items: center;">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 33%;" src="/images/culinaria/takoyaki2.webp" alt="">
                    <div style="max-width: 33%;">
                        <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="/images/culinaria/takoyaki3.webp" alt="">
                    </div>
                </div>
                Nothing much to say here, just put the dough and wait for it to be firm enough to turn around with a stick (i suck at this). <br>
                The heat didn't spread well so the ones on the edges took longer to finish. <br>
                Then take it off and put the sauce (that i didn't see the making). 
                If you want you can put some mayo and that thingie that sizzle when the takoyaki is hot (also didn't get the name srry T_T) <br>
                <br>
                Then the tori.
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%; align-items: center;">
                    <div style="margin: 5px; max-width: 33%;">
                        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/culinaria/yakitori2.webp" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 33%;" src="/images/culinaria/yakitori3.webp" alt="">
                </div>
                Also quite simple. Just take care to not burn your hands when turning their sides, cuz damn coal sure is hot (to the touch). <br>
                I don't have a picture of we putting the sauce, but when it's browned on the four sides you wet all the sides with sauce and put back in the grill.
                Since it has sugar, just a bit of time on the heat is sufficient. Take it off and it's ready to eat! <br>
                <br>
                Here's a well made plate (not mine)
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;">
                    <img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/prato-decente.webp" alt="">
                </div>
                <br>
                <h3>It was fine</h3>
                I think i don't like seafood that much. Idk, something in the flavor just don't click with me. <br>
                It wasn't bad, but for me it isn't something i would go after to eat on a regular basis. <br>
                The yakitori is great, will make at home eventually (still need a grill, a beetle hubcap will suffice) <br>
                <br>

                <h3>See ya next time o/</h3>
