                Hello hello again (○´∀`)ﾉﾞ★
                <br>
                As you may have already seen, there's a little change on the site !!! <br>
                Nothing big yet, just a little something i've been wanting to do for some time (*′∀`)b <br>
                I didn't test on everything and i know the cursors don't work on mbed, but i want to keep it simple using only css. That apart, today 
                we have 
                <br><br>
                <h3><br>.ﾟ+.(*´∀`).+ﾟ.Translation Notes (DQIX).ﾟ+.(´∀`*).+ﾟ.</h3>
                (that's why i won't translate to japanese, i don't think it would make sense) <br>
                That's more a list of words i found strange, but here we go. <br>
                First thing i noticed, the 
                <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonquest/images/3/33/DQIX_-_Stella.png">fairy</a> 
                uses lots of katakana. Even her name (サンディー/Sandy) uses katakana. And the words she uses are kinda different. By her looks and 
                speech, i'd dare to say that she's a stereotypical 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AE%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AB" class="link">gyaru</a>, since the game is old 
                (2009). Slangs like イケてる (iketeru; sexy/stylish/cool), that i <i>think</i> that uses the same イケ from イケメン (ikemen; hunk), 
                あんがと (angato), shortened from ありがとう (arigatō; thanks) and 元カノ (motokano), shortened from 元彼女 (motokanojo), that means 
                ex-girlfriend. <br>
                I won't remember all of them because i put every word i didn't know on the same dictionary list :P <br>
                <br>
                Besides her, there's the words that <i>seems</i> not to be used very much, i just dunno if it's because the game's old, because it 
                happens on mdieval times or because they're too specific and aren't used on daily life. Or i just didn't know them. There's that. <br>
                • 危なっかしい (abunakashii) - dangerous; same as 危ない (abunai), but seems to be used for something that <i>seems or may be</i> 
                dangerous, while the second is used for something that <i>definitely or already</i> is dangerous. Maybe has something to do with the 
                auxiliar らしい (rashii)? <br>
                • 箱舟 (hakobune) - ark; ermm.... not an ark?? It is obviously a 
                <a href="https://dragon-quest.org/images/e/e6/StarflightExpressFV.png" target="_blank">train</a>????? That apart, i think it isn't 
                used because it's <strong>too specific</strong>. Where would anyone use it outside, dunno, the bible. Who even builds an ark nowadays.
                <br>
                • 前言 (zengen) - previous remarks; literally before (前) and say (言). It's a noun, prolly shouldn't be used because of that. 
                I think. <br>
                • 平伏す (hirefusu) - to prostrate oneself before; seems kinda authoritary, i don't think it is used nowadays even when really bowing 
                before someone. <br>
                • 呼び込み (yobikomi) - person who calls clients to the store, or the act of doing if it has the auxiliary verb; uses the kanji of 
                calling and crowd. Thy tried to turn me into walking propaganda... <br>
                • 魔法使い (mahoutsukai) - magician; a thing i like on japanese is it having neutral words for nearly everything. In this case it is 
                the neutral for 魔女/魔男 (majo/madan; i don't think the second actually exists but there's poetic license to mix kanjis to create 
                words and i saw it being used on a recent manga (魔男のイチ; Ichi, the witch)). Verb conjugation and adjectives also don't use pronouns, 
                so there's more freedom on character writing and speech. But there's also words that socially perceived as used by specific groups, 
                so using them is seen as if you identify yourself in that group (slangs included). <br>
                • 息の根を止める (ikinonewotomeru)- lit. to make the breathing/life stop, to kill; here specifically i think it's the king not wanting 
                to say 殺す (korosu; kill) while his daughter is there. And also cuz he's a king. Anyway, first time i saw this expression till now. 
                <br>
                • 口づけ (kuchidzuke) - to kiss; makes sense having a word in japanese for this, but i had only saw キス (kisu) being used, which comes 
                from english (kiss). Must be dated. Probably. <br>
                • 口惜しい (kuchioshii) - frustrated; this one is really dated, old version of 悔しい (kuyashii). Propositally used for being medieval, 
                i think. <br> 
                • 婚礼 (konrei) - wedding ceremony; don't know if it's dated or specific for something within the wedding, because there is 結婚 
                (kekkon) that is wedding (verb and noun). <br> 
                <br>
                And that's the vocabulary i bring today !! I bookmarked a lot more, but most of them are just words i've never seen before. Like rpg 
                classes, weapons, UI, and so on. Words that's <i>probably</i> common on games (at least on old ones) and i've never seen because this 
                is the first game i play in japanese. I'll try to save words that seem dated on another list from now on to keep it more organized and 
                <strong><i>maybe</i></strong> brung these blosts more frequently. <br>
                <br>
                And last but not least, i have an announcement to make. We (i) now have a 
                <span style="color: var(--tertiary-font-color);">contact email</span>!!!! <br>
                <span style="color: var(--tertiary-font-color); font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">navomailster@gmail.com</span> <br>
                There you can send comments about blosts, complaints, sugestions and so on. Also a alternative for the comments i wanted to make, since 
                i currently can't pay for hosting an already made system and don't want to mess with data security to make a system with login... <br>
                <br>
                Well, that's it for today <br>
                Cya o/
