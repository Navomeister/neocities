                </div>
                nothing like months of inactivity to look back and see nothing to tell, amirite? but i still got some thingies and thoughts 
                to share, so why not. <br>
                <br>
                <h3>coop souls like</h3>
                i think it is poorly made. the coop of souls, that is. specially elden ring. like, a world of that size and you still need to 
                summon on specific places, without shared progress and returning to your own world after dying or killing a boss (things that 
                happen every 5 minutes). some basic QoL things that doesn't make sense not being made. the only reason i can imagine ppl not 
                wanting/including is the same thing they say about easy mode. that it would make souls-like easier. but you can just. 
                <strong>not</strong> use them. and the difficulty stays the same. <br>
                <br>
                <h3>i made some 3d</h3>
                remember i said i didn't know if i'd actually do something on 3d? still don't know cuz i probably already forgot everything i learnt, 
                but i made something. (also a basic animation) <br>

                <br>
                i like low poly <br> 
                i made it for the first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@untitldwav">untitled</a>'s project. that i also took part!!! <br>
                i like untilte.

                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>i finished that drawing</h3>
                the one i said i couldn't show because i was in the middle of the lineart. it was an excuse cuz i wasn't liking the result. 
                i finished, and still don't like it. so it will stay here.
                <div class="div-imagens">
                    <img src="/images/desenhos/foto em família 1.png" alt="" class="imagem-unica expandivel">
                </div>
                if i knew how to do sketches on color, this would be one of them. as i don't, i tried to finish it. and didn't like. <br>
                same for animation, i went straight on something too complex. i have to <strong>learn how to learn</strong>. or give up. 
                that's easier. <br>
                <br>
                <h3>animation</h3>
                nope, didn't finish last blost's animation. i made some more things on it, but i don't hav the willpower to continue since i know 
                it won't come out as i want beacuse i don't have enough experience. so i decided doing some smaller things, as i already should've 
                done, until i have the confidence to finish that ginourmous one.
                <div class="div-imagens">

                </div>
                in case i didn't polish it, ignore the lack of consistency. i tried to focus on <strong>finishing</strong> it this time. <br>
                <br>
                <h3>sketches</h3>
                to finish, some sketches i made while writing this.
