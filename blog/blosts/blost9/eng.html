                recently one thing took a lot of my time. cool fishes. casual games. and baldur's gate but we don't talk about it. <br>
                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
                    <img class="expandivel" style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/img-blosts/pecando.png" alt="">
                    <i style="font-size: small;">Cabas Pecando, rabiscos sobre tela digital 2024</i>
                </div>
                <p>
                    webfishing is really fun you should try it!! obviously like any social games there's weird, criminal or annoying people, but 
                    you can always ban them! (unless it's a hacker then you can't) <br>
                    there's a lot of fishes and things that aren't fish too, very cool. every one of them have some funsies on description. and 
                    customization!!!! i love customization.
                    <br><br>
                    also started playing Sun Haven, a game about farming and magic(ing). also cool, has more than one city to explore, something 
                    i missed on stardew. i wish three was a desert expansion and more interaction with sandy :( <br>
                    <br>
                    and i'll play Dragon Quest IX in japanese :D <br>
                    the language used in the game is kinda easy, it even shows the kanji's furigana. i'm playing on a 2ds, so it's a fun experience 
                    altough some of the furigana is hard to identify on the small screen... anyway, it'll be a fun study :) i'll try to make some 
                    translation notes to blost here. <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>SITE</h2>
                    now we have zoom on the pictures!!! just click a image on a blost or the main page. i only put it on images i deemed needed 
                    so no zoom on the funny gifs <br>
                    <br>
                    and about the site change, still no idea XD <br>
                    i want to try putting comments to see what is the tape (bad translation intended) but it seems complicated... well sometime 
                    something will change, no rush. <br>
                    <br>
                    and that's it for today, cya o/
