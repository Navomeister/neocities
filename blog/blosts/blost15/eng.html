            <p>
                Recently i've been jog hunting (if anyone wants to hire me i accept) in any area i can. My CV doesn't have anything too impressive, 
                but there's a lot of things without connection between them. I don't know if this makes finding a job easier or harder. I've heard 
                people talking about "over-qualifying", and that it may make it harder to land a "basic-er" job. Until now i've done 2 job interviews, 
                only passed one and it's distance and schedule wasn't viable to me (2 hours from home 6 days a week for minimum wage). 
                It was on this interview i heard the question, and i really don't know how i was approved.
                <br>
                <br>
                'Twas a group interview, there was another interviewee before me. Since they were first, i got ready based on what they asked them. 
                <strong>They didn't ask them about it.</strong> I already thought i wasn't doing well before it, but my head went _blank after this. 
                I literally replied "I don't know". I had already talked about my CV and that i don't have previous jobs, so i didn't know what to 
                say. I already had to make up a reason to want the job (customer service on an insurance company, i didn't want the job) and make up 
                something that caught my eye about it, but i had time to make both beforehand since they asked the other person as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                I dunno a reason to hire me besides having workforce. I don't want to be paid to work in anything at all. I deffo don't want to 
                turn a hobby into a job, and finding a job as a programmer, that's something i'd work with, isn't really easy. I think getting class 
                consciouness before my first job kinda wrecked me, i can't simply accept working 48 weekly hours for a minimum wage, even though 
                i don't have even this now, even more knowing about power harassment cases that happen, and would prolly happen to me as well. Maybe 
                i lack suffering through my life to anesthize my mind 'bout this. Not that it is a good thing to have.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently i don't have the willpower to work even on my personal projects. When i'm doing something i always remember about something 
                else that i want and should be doing, lose focus on what i'm doing and end up doing nothing, looking for something to distract myself 
                from thoughts. Then i remember i did nothing the entire day and sleep sad about it :D (vicious cicle do not recommend). I hope having 
                an animation done by the end of the year and will try not to start anything big so i can focus on remaking this site after it. Dunno 
                if it's obvious but this site is pastafarian. I need a DB at least...
                <br><br>
                Well, until then here's some thingies i made, cya o/
