                        I said on my <i>"""farewell chost"""</i> that i made the recipe
                        <a href="https://ninecoffees.blog/"><strong>@ninecoffees</strong></a> sent to 
                        <a href="https://cohost.org/NekoRaita"><strong>@NekoRaita</strong></a>, and, well, here is it's chost :D <br>
                        <br>
                        A little late i know, but i didn't have the guts to make it on cohost. Won't talk about it here, already said more than i 
                        should've on there and my sanity is still hanging on enough to hold me from doing it again (√≥Ôπè√≤ÔΩ°) <br>
                        <br>
                        First of all, i made <i><strong>a LOT</strong></i> of mistakes, and the kitchen here wasn't made to bake such things... 
                        Anyway, the lack of experience and equipment got in the way.

                    <h4>Part 1 - Crust</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here's the first ordeal. I noticed (late) that <strong>there's no space in here.</strong><br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yeah that's <strong>all</strong> the space i had to do the dough. Yes it's right next to the kitchen sink, but i washed 
                        and dried it before using. Even put plastic wrapper underneath!!! Even though it didn't hel a bit... Anyway, the crust 
                        went better than the rest.

                        The dough was homogeneous, no lumps or butter without mixing. And it was firm. Wrapped and put in the fridge as said in the 
                        recipe.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Part 2 - Filling</h4>

                        Didn't say at the beggining but i was following the recipe <strong><i>one by one</i></strong>. This was the root of 
                        most of the problems. The white bow is the biggest we have here and <strong>i couldn't mix</strong> the filling with it alone. 
                        I literally <strong><i>weighed the apples so it was the same as the recipe.</i></strong> <br>
                        <br>
                        It said 1360g. <br>
                        <i>Apparently</i> my brain don't understand physics. <br>
                        Nor about future. <br> 
                        <br>
                        I had to use two bowls to mix everything. And <strong>there wasn't enough vanilla extract.</strong> <br>
                        It had about half a tablespoon i think. But the tast was ok. <i style="opacity: 33%;">just seemed too rich....</i>

                        The problem, my dear reader, is that the pie should've <strong>cooked<i> inside</i></strong> too.

                        It was hard to even take a piece out. But what counts is the taste, amirite? <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong><i>I was the only one who didn't like it.</i></strong> <br>
                        It wasn't bad or anything, it was just <strong>too rich</strong> for my taste. Eating <i>a whole</i> piece was an ordeal. 
                        Won't lie, kinda broke my "dreams" 'bout apple pie.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Yeah...</h3>
                    <p>
                        I need more kitchenware. At least some cake/pie pans. Also, Neko made it on a glass pan and it cooked better than mine, maybe 
                        it's my oven or the appl variety i had idk... <br>
                        Eventually i'll see some other apple pie recipes, maybe i didn't like it because it had (apple) vinegar on thee filling. <br>
                        And i definitelly can use more kitchen experience, although i'm almost the Housewife/husband‚Ñ¢ on here. <br>
                        <br>
                        Aaand i guess that's it. Happy new year? cya o/
