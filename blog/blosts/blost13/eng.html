                Hi hi hi hiiiiiiiiiih i hi hiii hi hhi :D <br>
                Here for another round of Things I've done Recently Or Not So Much Recently™. There's quite a few things methinks. At least for me. <br>
                <br>
                I'll talk about them in order so it'll be easier to remember. <br>
                <br>
                <h6>19/01 ~ 30/01</h6>
                Firstly we have the <a href="https://navomusicas.bandcamp.com/track/sillytypebeat-wav">sillytypebeat.wav</a>, that's my first 
                iteration of vocaloid in music!! (although it's just some hastly made backing vocal :P) <br>
                Twas a lil something that came from nowhere, just playing a bit. One thing that made me want to do music was using funny samples on 
                it (while making it good), for example in 
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AYzh3blu010&si=QTNenQN2kHH1N73Y">these</a> 
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=7F4bV_eIZfM&si=1FPsKG_UozcaWuMr">songs</a> 
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=E9PGNRcbx-o&si=0P9Gt8DiGVNO5Sfs">i</a> 
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ptuTUNGxVng&si=_j6bdBf_kdB-FUXR">hear</a>. You probably don't know it but some of these 
                have really strange lyrics. Yeah. <br>
                Also need to talk about <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=gfozEKCC1Og&si=GDW9Laj2Y-qW62ZF">this</a> one. Damn. That 
                glitched drop. please give me more. please let me someday be able to make 10% of this <br>
                I'm still not satisfied with my mixing level buuut a year of (badly done) self learning is a really small time to learn how to 
                do quality stuff. Sooooooooooooooooooo i'll take this excuse for the time being till i'm satisfied with my things :D <br>
                But i think my timing is kinda good. At least the samples seem to fit in. <br>
                <br>
                There's a little something that involves Calma Calabreso (if you know you know) and Meaium Music but i didn' like it enough to show. 
                Maybe it'll show somewhere someday if i redo it :P <br>
                <br>
                <h6>06/02</h6>
                Then we have the sharks that are swimming back there :D <br>
                They're the same species that where on the old background, i just redrew and made a second frame to make them swim. Since this site is 
                a simple project, i made it mainly in css. Js only takes care of creation and flipping. <br>
                If you've already let the site on background for some reason, you may have noticed that they sometimes swim backwards. 
                Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeell... <br>
                That's because they flip based on animation iteration, so since the browser suspends the page for RAM reasons it may happen. <br>
                The random size and opacity is to give the feeling of depth, <a href="https://www.nekoraita.art.br">Neko</a>'s idea.<br>
                <br>
                <h6>11/02</h6>
                Then there'ws another music! This one was made in 3ish hours. Made it to test some VSTs i downloaded. It is simple and didn't came out 
                as i wanted, but i kinda liked it.
                <br>
                <audio src="https://f.feridinha.com/UZ5yQ.wav" controls class="audio-blost"></audio>
                <br>
                I always miss something on the beat when trying to make a bossa novaish thing. The piano tone and percussion always sound wrong. 
                I didn't even get to the second piano, that is kinda the "vocal", so that's missing too.
                <br>
                Anywayyyy i got to test some VSTs so it's still a win !! <br>
                <br>
                Around this time i also started an animation that i NEED to get back to soon. I have an "storyboard" of it here to show wait a moment.
                <br>
                <video src="https://f.feridinha.com/SW9rS.mp4" controls class="video-blost"></video>
                <br>
                It is meant to be a <strong>simple</strong> thing. I shall mantain it <strong>simple</strong> and shalln't make it 
                <strong>complicated</strong>. <br>
                And a drawing of OCs, also in progress. And also something i need to <strong>go back soon</strong>. No preview because it's 
                still kinda raw soooo.<br>
                <br>
                <h6>23/02</h6>
                The <a href="https://github.com/Navomeister/musicathon/">Subathonic Music Box</a>!! <br>
                Quick project of 2 days, would be cooler if it was an actual music box but i'm not a hardware person :P <br>
                Some of the funny fonts glitches cuz they don't have some of the characters, but that's also funny so i let it in. Just don't look 
                at the site's <strong>console</strong> and you should be fine. <br>
                <br>
                <h6>18/02 ~ 04/03</h6>
                We got to the day this blost was written, and to the newest project added to the main page! <br>
                <video src="https://f.feridinha.com/LyD1t.mp4" controls class="video-blost"></video>
                <br>
                It's a cover to learn how to vocaloid, but i <strong>overcomplicated</strong> it. You may have noticed while watching it but i 
                <strong>don't</strong> know how to edit. It is not one of my hobbies/interests. But it is something i'll need to learn to improve 
                other things, i guess. I'm doing so much and making so little at the same time....................................... <br>
                I already changed the vocal 3 times after exporting the video, and there's still things i find to change while listening again. 
                but i'll never finish this <strong>study</strong> cover if i keep at this. I need to sav the perfeccionism for 
                <strong>actual projects</strong> and not <strong>training projects</strong>. <br>
                Anyways, the <a href="/images/desenhos/テトを上げな.png">art</a> if you want to see it closer (would not recommend) <br>
                <br>
                These things aside, i'm still studying japanese. Although Dragon Quest is now kinda on hold... It was more interesting on my 
                memory, i guess replaying the same thing a few times takes a toll on it's fun. On the first time i got a bit stuck i already got 
                lazy to look around. And reading the last story dialogue doesn't make things clear for me... <br>
                But on the upside, i'm reading Sakamoto Days in japanese! And it's SO INTERESTING. I never thought i would be this invested on 
                shounen manga. I read 50 chapters <strong>while using dictionary</strong> in <strong>a week</strong>. The story is SO GOOD. They 
                really knew what they were doing. <br>
                Something i've been noticing is that i frequently have to search for the same words i had already seen before, haven't been 
                getting the vocabulary well :/ <br>
                I have to find some way to remember the words i search for, maybe taking notes phisically could help instead of just searching for 
                it when it is convenient. I'll try it out. <br> <br>
                I'll take the chance to talk about music as well. Although i tend to hear only my EVERYTHING playlist (aka everything i've heard 
                and liked) on random, i've also been chain-listening to 
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCH4QF9-ZNyDzlLY-vBglGhQ">Astrophysics</a>, to be more specific their project
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCmrM9WpOpDWG3Nb3mhfsyzQ">SEXCORP.</a>. Absolute music. Both their
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mNAyWPPdOR7XChV7YFyIVZi1gFAa3UpRs&si=OtDG_okiTb9oP185">alb</a><a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l7OuI-gPpc3IHR7TVUm9GzySKA2BV8MEk&si=iQhpTYizi4An7v83">ums</a> 
                are really good, even more when listening to the entire album on one go. <br>
                Also <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCsrf178D7cjgbhrxfcIWcXg">Kikuo</a>, specifically  
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=wnQf_5k2CUc&si=qFBqIYAUXjpFQG_P">this</a> song they made with  
                <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCh_J1vzZFXmYlL42Tqq4T6w?si=HSBwLV6-ssJB-Etq">花たん</a> (hanatan). I'm literally 
                <strong>addicted</strong> to this song. Truly. How can people be so good in what they do. The vocal. The song. The 
                <strong>animation</strong>. Everything is so good... <br>
                <br>
                Lastly and prolly less important, i'm trying to mess with 3D. Dunno if it's something that will last long cuz i haven't even 
                finished my first thing on blender, so yeah prolly less important XD <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                And were done with the Things™! This will be so much work to translate!!! <br>
                Looking back kinda seems like a lot of things, but i always feel like i do so little... I guess the quantity of drawings used to do 
                in <a href="https://f.feridinha.com/0T3sb.png">2023</a> spoiled me a bit... <br>
                Anyways, here's where i'll be bidding my tinkerty-tonks. Cya and fuck around with things!!! fucking around is the means to finding 
                out and the origin of many good things.
