                    Hi hi hi hiiiiiiiiiih i hi hiii hi hhi :D &lt;br&gt;
                    Here for another round of Things I've done Recently Or Not So Much Recently™. There's quite a few things methinks. At least for me. &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    I'll talk about them in order so it'll be easier to remember. &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;h6&gt;19/01 ~ 30/01&lt;/h6&gt;
                    Firstly we have the &lt;a href="https://navomusicas.bandcamp.com/track/sillytypebeat-wav"&gt;sillytypebeat.wav&lt;/a&gt;, that's my first 
                    iteration of vocaloid in music!! (although it's just some hastly made backing vocal :P) &lt;br&gt;
                    Twas a lil something that came from nowhere, just playing a bit. One thing that made me want to do music was using funny samples on 
                    it (while making it good), for example in 
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AYzh3blu010&si=QTNenQN2kHH1N73Y"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; 
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=7F4bV_eIZfM&si=1FPsKG_UozcaWuMr"&gt;songs&lt;/a&gt; 
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=E9PGNRcbx-o&si=0P9Gt8DiGVNO5Sfs"&gt;i&lt;/a&gt; 
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ptuTUNGxVng&si=_j6bdBf_kdB-FUXR"&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt;. You probably don't know it but some of these 
                    have really strange lyrics. Yeah. &lt;br&gt;
                    Also need to talk about &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=gfozEKCC1Og&si=GDW9Laj2Y-qW62ZF"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; one. Damn. That 
                    glitched drop. please give me more. please let me someday be able to make 10% of this &lt;br&gt;
                    I'm still not satisfied with my mixing level buuut a year of (badly done) self learning is a really small time to learn how to 
                    do quality stuff. Sooooooooooooooooooo i'll take this excuse for the time being till i'm satisfied with my things :D &lt;br&gt;
                    But i think my timing is kinda good. At least the samples seem to fit in. &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    There's a little something that involves Calma Calabreso (if you know you know) and Meaium Music but i didn' like it enough to show. 
                    Maybe it'll show somewhere someday if i redo it :P &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;h6&gt;06/02&lt;/h6&gt;
                    Then we have the sharks that are swimming back there :D &lt;br&gt;
                    They're the same species that where on the old background, i just redrew and made a second frame to make them swim. Since this site is 
                    a simple project, i made it mainly in css. Js only takes care of creation and flipping. &lt;br&gt;
                    If you've already let the site on background for some reason, you may have noticed that they sometimes swim backwards. 
                    Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeell... &lt;br&gt;
                    That's because they flip based on animation iteration, so since the browser suspends the page for RAM reasons it may happen. &lt;br&gt;
                    The random size and opacity is to give the feeling of depth, &lt;a href="https://www.nekoraita.art.br"&gt;Neko&lt;/a&gt;'s idea.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;h6&gt;11/02&lt;/h6&gt;
                    Then there'ws another music! This one was made in 3ish hours. Made it to test some VSTs i downloaded. It is simple and didn't came out 
                    as i wanted, but i kinda liked it.
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;audio src="https://f.feridinha.com/UZ5yQ.wav" controls class="audio-blost"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    I always miss something on the beat when trying to make a bossa novaish thing. The piano tone and percussion always sound wrong. 
                    I didn't even get to the second piano, that is kinda the "vocal", so that's missing too.
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    Anywayyyy i got to test some VSTs so it's still a win !! &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    Around this time i also started an animation that i NEED to get back to soon. I have an "storyboard" of it here to show wait a moment.
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;video src="https://f.feridinha.com/SW9rS.mp4" controls class="video-blost"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    It is meant to be a &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; thing. I shall mantain it &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; and shalln't make it 
                    &lt;strong&gt;complicated&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
                    And a drawing of OCs, also in progress. And also something i need to &lt;strong&gt;go back soon&lt;/strong&gt;. No preview because it's 
                    still kinda raw soooo.&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;h6&gt;23/02&lt;/h6&gt;
                    The &lt;a href="https://github.com/Navomeister/musicathon/"&gt;Subathonic Music Box&lt;/a&gt;!! &lt;br&gt;
                    Quick project of 2 days, would be cooler if it was an actual music box but i'm not a hardware person :P &lt;br&gt;
                    Some of the funny fonts glitches cuz they don't have some of the characters, but that's also funny so i let it in. Just don't look 
                    at the site's &lt;strong&gt;console&lt;/strong&gt; and you should be fine. &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;h6&gt;18/02 ~ 04/03&lt;/h6&gt;
                    We got to the day this blost was written, and to the newest project added to the main page! &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;video src="https://f.feridinha.com/LyD1t.mp4" controls class="video-blost"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    It's a cover to learn how to vocaloid, but i &lt;strong&gt;overcomplicated&lt;/strong&gt; it. You may have noticed while watching it but i 
                    &lt;strong&gt;don't&lt;/strong&gt; know how to edit. It is not one of my hobbies/interests. But it is something i'll need to learn to improve 
                    other things, i guess. I'm doing so much and making so little at the same time....................................... &lt;br&gt;
                    I already changed the vocal 3 times after exporting the video, and there's still things i find to change while listening again. 
                    but i'll never finish this &lt;strong&gt;study&lt;/strong&gt; cover if i keep at this. I need to sav the perfeccionism for 
                    &lt;strong&gt;actual projects&lt;/strong&gt; and not &lt;strong&gt;training projects&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
                    Anyways, the &lt;a href="/images/desenhos/テトを上げな.png"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see it closer (would not recommend) &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    These things aside, i'm still studying japanese. Although Dragon Quest is now kinda on hold... It was more interesting on my 
                    memory, i guess replaying the same thing a few times takes a toll on it's fun. On the first time i got a bit stuck i already got 
                    lazy to look around. And reading the last story dialogue doesn't make things clear for me... &lt;br&gt;
                    But on the upside, i'm reading Sakamoto Days in japanese! And it's SO INTERESTING. I never thought i would be this invested on 
                    shounen manga. I read 50 chapters &lt;strong&gt;while using dictionary&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;a week&lt;/strong&gt;. The story is SO GOOD. They 
                    really knew what they were doing. &lt;br&gt;
                    Something i've been noticing is that i frequently have to search for the same words i had already seen before, haven't been 
                    getting the vocabulary well :/ &lt;br&gt;
                    I have to find some way to remember the words i search for, maybe taking notes phisically could help instead of just searching for 
                    it when it is convenient. I'll try it out. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                    I'll take the chance to talk about music as well. Although i tend to hear only my EVERYTHING playlist (aka everything i've heard 
                    and liked) on random, i've also been chain-listening to 
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCH4QF9-ZNyDzlLY-vBglGhQ"&gt;Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;, to be more specific their project
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCmrM9WpOpDWG3Nb3mhfsyzQ"&gt;SEXCORP.&lt;/a&gt;. Absolute music. Both their
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mNAyWPPdOR7XChV7YFyIVZi1gFAa3UpRs&si=OtDG_okiTb9oP185"&gt;alb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l7OuI-gPpc3IHR7TVUm9GzySKA2BV8MEk&si=iQhpTYizi4An7v83"&gt;ums&lt;/a&gt; 
                    are really good, even more when listening to the entire album on one go. &lt;br&gt;
                    Also &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCsrf178D7cjgbhrxfcIWcXg"&gt;Kikuo&lt;/a&gt;, specifically  
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=wnQf_5k2CUc&si=qFBqIYAUXjpFQG_P"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; song they made with  
                    &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCh_J1vzZFXmYlL42Tqq4T6w?si=HSBwLV6-ssJB-Etq"&gt;花たん&lt;/a&gt; (hanatan). I'm literally 
                    &lt;strong&gt;addicted&lt;/strong&gt; to this song. Truly. How can people be so good in what they do. The vocal. The song. The 
                    &lt;strong&gt;animation&lt;/strong&gt;. Everything is so good... &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    Lastly and prolly less important, i'm trying to mess with 3D. Dunno if it's something that will last long cuz i haven't even 
                    finished my first thing on blender, so yeah prolly less important XD &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    And were done with the Things™! This will be so much work to translate!!! &lt;br&gt;
                    Looking back kinda seems like a lot of things, but i always feel like i do so little... I guess the quantity of drawings used to do 
                    in &lt;a href="https://f.feridinha.com/0T3sb.png"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt; spoiled me a bit... &lt;br&gt;
                    Anyways, here's where i'll be bidding my tinkerty-tonks. Cya and fuck around with things!!! fucking around is the means to finding 
                    out and the origin of many good things.

                    Hello hello again (○´∀`)ﾉﾞ★
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    As you may have already seen, there's a little change on the site !!! &lt;br&gt;
                    Nothing big yet, just a little something i've been wanting to do for some time (*′∀`)b &lt;br&gt;
                    I didn't test on everything and i know the cursors don't work on mbed, but i want to keep it simple using only css. That apart, today 
                    we have 
                    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;.ﾟ+.(*´∀`).+ﾟ.Translation Notes (DQIX).ﾟ+.(´∀`*).+ﾟ.&lt;/h3&gt;
                    (that's why i won't translate to japanese, i don't think it would make sense) &lt;br&gt;
                    That's more a list of words i found strange, but here we go. &lt;br&gt;
                    First thing i noticed, the 
                    &lt;a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonquest/images/3/33/DQIX_-_Stella.png"&gt;fairy&lt;/a&gt; 
                    uses lots of katakana. Even her name (サンディー/Sandy) uses katakana. And the words she uses are kinda different. By her looks and 
                    speech, i'd dare to say that she's a stereotypical 
                    &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AE%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AB" class="link"&gt;gyaru&lt;/a&gt;, since the game is old 
                    (2009). Slangs like イケてる (iketeru; sexy/stylish/cool), that i &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; that uses the same イケ from イケメン (ikemen; hunk), 
                    あんがと (angato), shortened from ありがとう (arigatō; thanks) and 元カノ (motokano), shortened from 元彼女 (motokanojo), that means 
                    ex-girlfriend. &lt;br&gt;
                    I won't remember all of them because i put every word i didn't know on the same dictionary list :P &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    Besides her, there's the words that &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; not to be used very much, i just dunno if it's because the game's old, because it 
                    happens on mdieval times or because they're too specific and aren't used on daily life. Or i just didn't know them. There's that. &lt;br&gt;
                    • 危なっかしい (abunakashii) - dangerous; same as 危ない (abunai), but seems to be used for something that &lt;i&gt;seems or may be&lt;/i&gt; 
                    dangerous, while the second is used for something that &lt;i&gt;definitely or already&lt;/i&gt; is dangerous. Maybe has something to do with the 
                    auxiliar らしい (rashii)? &lt;br&gt;
                    • 箱舟 (hakobune) - ark; ermm.... not an ark?? It is obviously a 
                    &lt;a href="https://dragon-quest.org/images/e/e6/StarflightExpressFV.png" target="_blank"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;????? That apart, i think it isn't 
                    used because it's &lt;strong&gt;too specific&lt;/strong&gt;. Where would anyone use it outside, dunno, the bible. Who even builds an ark nowadays.
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    • 前言 (zengen) - previous remarks; literally before (前) and say (言). It's a noun, prolly shouldn't be used because of that. 
                    I think. &lt;br&gt;
                    • 平伏す (hirefusu) - to prostrate oneself before; seems kinda authoritary, i don't think it is used nowadays even when really bowing 
                    before someone. &lt;br&gt;
                    • 呼び込み (yobikomi) - person who calls clients to the store, or the act of doing if it has the auxiliary verb; uses the kanji of 
                    calling and crowd. Thy tried to turn me into walking propaganda... &lt;br&gt;
                    • 魔法使い (mahoutsukai) - magician; a thing i like on japanese is it having neutral words for nearly everything. In this case it is 
                    the neutral for 魔女/魔男 (majo/madan; i don't think the second actually exists but there's poetic license to mix kanjis to create 
                    words and i saw it being used on a recent manga (魔男のイチ; Ichi, the witch)). Verb conjugation and adjectives also don't use pronouns, 
                    so there's more freedom on character writing and speech. But there's also words that socially perceived as used by specific groups, 
                    so using them is seen as if you identify yourself in that group (slangs included). &lt;br&gt;
                    • 息の根を止める (ikinonewotomeru)- lit. to make the breathing/life stop, to kill; here specifically i think it's the king not wanting 
                    to say 殺す (korosu; kill) while his daughter is there. And also cuz he's a king. Anyway, first time i saw this expression till now. 
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    • 口づけ (kuchidzuke) - to kiss; makes sense having a word in japanese for this, but i had only saw キス (kisu) being used, which comes 
                    from english (kiss). Must be dated. Probably. &lt;br&gt;
                    • 口惜しい (kuchioshii) - frustrated; this one is really dated, old version of 悔しい (kuyashii). Propositally used for being medieval, 
                    i think. &lt;br&gt; 
                    • 婚礼 (konrei) - wedding ceremony; don't know if it's dated or specific for something within the wedding, because there is 結婚 
                    (kekkon) that is wedding (verb and noun). &lt;br&gt; 
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    And that's the vocabulary i bring today !! I bookmarked a lot more, but most of them are just words i've never seen before. Like rpg 
                    classes, weapons, UI, and so on. Words that's &lt;i&gt;probably&lt;/i&gt; common on games (at least on old ones) and i've never seen because this 
                    is the first game i play in japanese. I'll try to save words that seem dated on another list from now on to keep it more organized and 
                    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; brung these blosts more frequently. &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    And last but not least, i have an announcement to make. We (i) now have a 
                    &lt;span style="color: var(--tertiary-font-color);"&gt;contact email&lt;/span&gt;!!!! &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;span style="color: var(--tertiary-font-color); font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;"&gt;navomailster@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                    There you can send comments about blosts, complaints, sugestions and so on. Also a alternative for the comments i wanted to make, since 
                    i currently can't pay for hosting an already made system and don't want to mess with data security to make a system with login... &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    Well, that's it for today &lt;br&gt;

                    Blost with some frequency? In my website?? Unlikely. &lt;br&gt;
                    Jokes aside, i finished the rawing i said i was doing :D &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;div class="div-imagens"&gt;
                        &lt;img class="expandivel imagem-unica" src="/images/desenhos/trigemeas.webp" alt=""&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Can't say i'm satisfied with everything, my lack of experience with background and lighting is kinda obvious here :/ &lt;br&gt;
                        And feet. Why is it so hard to draw feet??? Doesn't make sense?? I don't want to draw feet to practice... &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        Also need to do more background interaction, mattress is not supposed to be so plain. &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        Perspective... Is perspective.
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;strong&gt;
                    iframe
                    &lt;\strong&gt;
                    &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;div class="div-imagens"&gt;
                        &lt;div class="caixa2-3"&gt;
                            &lt;iframe class="iframe-element" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysRUjwsxa2c?si=_TaxqRQO31qukMCb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        As you can see i tend to forget background elements a lot. Had to go back sometimes to draw things that was missing in the 
                        timelapse export :) &lt;br&gt;
                        And i have to think more about decoration, there's few. The lack of creativity seeps into the the characters personalities 
                        expression :/ &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        Will take the chance to present them here, they're triplets of a witch family i created. The one in the middle is the "oldest", 
                        Amarilis. The one on the right is the "middle sister", Unxia. The one on the left is the "youngest", Viola. Eventually the rest 
                        of the family will be presented. Eventually.
                    &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h2&gt;GAMES&lt;/h2&gt;
                    recently one thing took a lot of my time. cool fishes. casual games. and baldur's gate but we don't talk about it. &lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;"&gt;
                        &lt;img class="expandivel" style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/img-blosts/pecando.png" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;i style="text-align: end; font-size: small;"&gt;Cabas Pecando, 2024&lt;/i&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        webfishing is really fun you should try it!! obviously like any social games there's weird, criminal or annoying people, but 
                        you can always ban them! (unless it's a hacker then you can't) &lt;br&gt;
                        there's a lot of fishes and things that aren't fish too, very cool. every one of them have some funsies on description. and 
                        customization!!!! i love customization.
                        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                        also started playing Sun Haven, a game about farming and magic(ing). also cool, has more than one city to explore, something 
                        i missed on stardew. i wish three was a desert expansion and more interaction with sandy :( &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        and i'll play Dragon Quest IX in japanese :D &lt;br&gt;
                        the language used in the game is kinda easy, it even shows the kanji's furigana. i'm playing on a 2ds, so it's a fun experience 
                        altough some of the furigana is hard to identify on the small screen... anyway, it'll be a fun study :) i'll try to make some 
                        translation notes to blost here. &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;SITE&lt;/h2&gt;
                        now we have zoom on the pictures!!! just click a image on a blost or the main page. i only put it on images i deemed needed 
                        so no zoom on the funny gifs &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        and about the site change, still no idea XD &lt;br&gt;
                        i want to try putting comments to see what is the tape (bad translation intended) but it seems complicated... well sometime 
                        something will change, no rush. &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        and that's it for today, cya o/

                    &lt;p style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"&gt;
                        so &lt;br&gt;
                        ha ha, hello. no, i didn't die, i was just beaten by my lack of frequncy and things to talk about XD &lt;br&gt;
                        coming from the last post, the music is done (not exactly but i won't be changing anything cuz i gave myself a deadline and intend 
                        to respect it) and it is here !! &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;iframe style="align-self: center; margin: 1vh;" width="300" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBzjVycVEgs?si=EUi2aL0LF8iBl62J" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
                        lots of things i'd change buuuuuuut it's best to move on to the next so i have more experiences. &lt;br&gt;
                        available on 
                        &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/L2yJXU4jpTb268cX6"&gt;bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, 
                        &lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=hBzjVycVEgs"&gt;youtube music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/L2yJXU4jpTb268cX6"&gt;soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            &lt;br&gt;
                            and, will write it here to put pression on myself so i actually do it, i will make some layout changes, some thing i want to 
                            change. may not be next post's topic, but will eventually come. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                            also i have a kinda big drawing in progress, maybe i'll finish it this year :O (actually two but we don't talk about the 
                            other one) &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                            and that is it. i would say "till next week" but we both know that's probably a lie &lt;br&gt;
                            later o/
                        &lt;/p&gt;

                        ehem &lt;br&gt;
                        i said i an making a music, right?? so.... this is how it is doing till now 👍 &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDz3TzCmS9M?si=Q4hzjXUffsqsy488"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        i think it is needless to say i'm still a beginner. this is the fourth (?) thing i'm doing fr, and surely the best one until now. &lt;br&gt;
                        i also relied less on the base sample !!! i think &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        a late blost again but that's it, cya o/

                        recently i've been doing an animation, maybe you know where it comes from it's a bit famous (joke) &lt;/div&gt;
                        (iframe here, maybe won't load)
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"&gt;

                        i'm doing this to learn a bit more, i need practice and have zero ideas to animate so i thought maybe this would help.
                        dunno if it will leave the sketch fase but probably it will be only on december, i have another project i &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to finish this year. &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        it's a music, and a great idea for compost #6 but i had it after it ended :( &lt;br&gt;
                        i will really try to finish thism but with my lack of experience and creativity i can't promise anything. &lt;br&gt;
                        i don't want to spoiler it but also can't raise expectations what do  do o_O &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        anyway, i'll do this kinda post when i have nothing to post on the week, and try to make on post a week at least &lt;br&gt;
                        till next time o/

                        It seems to a 10 meter radius colony, few mushrooms but a good distance between them &lt;br&gt;
                        I don't know how to identify mushrooms (yet) but &lt;i&gt;apparently&lt;/i&gt; it's from the Agaricus genus &lt;br&gt;
                        Also couldn't get a sample cuz someone killed it :( &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        small blost but that's it for the wek, cya o/

                        It's an improvised one i made, there's one for each language. (pages with x language redirect to it's own rss) &lt;br&gt;
                        I intend to make, sometimes, posts exclusive to one language, since some things really can't be translated without losing it's 
                        meaning (haiku, for example) &lt;br&gt;
                        Maybe some rosts (rss exclusive posts) who knows (says the one who barely posts normally). &lt;br&gt;
                        For the time being, it has only the blosts. Blog aside, i will also put the index's things i post from here on &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        Until then, see ya o/

                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Remember that i'm studying japanese? So, the school i got a one year scholarship is a "language and culture school". 
                        I'm currently on the sewing club (were sewing a happi, will post about it sometime later) and sometimes we have a culinary class. 
                        I beg for the cooking gods' forgiveness cuz i suck at plate presentation. (also at taking pictures but that's another story)&lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        Last time (that i didn't post) we made gyōza, harusame salad and miso soup &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/receitaG.webp" alt=""&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/gyouza.webp" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        This time we made takoyaki, onigiri and yakitori. &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/receita1.webp" alt=""&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/receita2.webp" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/prato2.webp" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;h3&gt;Getting ready&lt;/h3&gt;
                        First we did the takoyaki and yakitori sauces. &lt;br&gt;
                        Since we were in 12, i had to count &lt;strong&gt;50&lt;/strong&gt; spoonfuls of shōyu, plus 30 of sugar and 10 of sake (the cooking one). 
                        Then we boiled the sake to get the alcohol out, then added the shōyu and sugar. &lt;br&gt;
                        After it started to grow we took it off the stove and lowered the heat to put it again. 
                        Since we don't have a centennial tare, we just took out a bit of the foam. &lt;br&gt;
                        (I didn't see the takoyaki sauce being made so i can't describe it's recipe :/) &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        Then we got to cut the chicken breast. &lt;br&gt;
                        First take the skin bits out, then cut off the most thick edge, and last but not least cut in half the remaining breast. 
                        The thin part of these two halves will be in the end of the stick, so when cutting the three parts in bite-sized bits make sure to split them. 
                        At the same time other people where cutting the green onion for both the takoyaki and yakitori, thinly for the first and long for the other.
                        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;h3&gt;Putting it together&lt;/h3&gt;
                        For the takoyaki dough you will need eggs, flour, water and the green onions (we also put some teeny tiny shrimpies but i &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; that is optional?). &lt;br&gt;
                        Mix first the water and eggs, then slowly add the flour while mixing, and lastly the green onions and shrimps. &lt;br&gt;
                        After this, cut the octopus in tiny bits that will fit in a takoyaki ball (something around half to one centimeter i think)&lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/takoyaki1.webp" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        For the yakitori we measured 4~5 fingers before the round edge of the stick to have where to grasp.
                        Then, in the same direction the chicken's fibers go, we pierced it. It is quite simple, first one of the thick chicken bits then a green onion, and repeat.
                        When getting close to the sharp tip (around 2 fingers), you put one of the thin chicken cut, but since it is thin you put it folded. &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/yakitori1.webp" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        The rice for the onigiri is the easiest, since the teacher got an electric rice cooker. &lt;br&gt;
                        A handful of rice is enough, so put this much in a bowl using a spoon. 
                        Then wet your hands with water and get some salt on those hands. &lt;br&gt;
                        Now take the rice and start shaping it with your hands. If you want a filling, put it in the middle before shaping. &lt;br&gt;
                        To shape, basically make a triangle with each of your hands. The upper one sideways and the lower one pointed fowards. Then press and spin. &lt;br&gt;
                        And you're done! If you want, put some furikake or a nori on it. &lt;br&gt; 
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 33%;" src="/images/culinaria/onigiri.webp" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;h3&gt;"Yaki-ing 'em Ts"&lt;/h3&gt;
                        We were in groups, and mine was the first in the onigiri (result above). &lt;br&gt;
                        After that we went to the takoyaki machine.
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%; align-items: center;"&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 33%;" src="/images/culinaria/takoyaki2.webp" alt=""&gt;
                            &lt;div style="max-width: 33%;"&gt;
                                &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="/images/culinaria/takoyaki3.webp" alt=""&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        Nothing much to say here, just put the dough and wait for it to be firm enough to turn around with a stick (i suck at this). &lt;br&gt;
                        The heat didn't spread well so the ones on the edges took longer to finish. &lt;br&gt;
                        Then take it off and put the sauce (that i didn't see the making). 
                        If you want you can put some mayo and that thingie that sizzle when the takoyaki is hot (also didn't get the name srry T_T) &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        Then the tori.
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%; align-items: center;"&gt;
                            &lt;div style="margin: 5px; max-width: 33%;"&gt;
                                &lt;img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/culinaria/yakitori2.webp" alt=""&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 33%;" src="/images/culinaria/yakitori3.webp" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        Also quite simple. Just take care to not burn your hands when turning their sides, cuz damn coal sure is hot (to the touch). &lt;br&gt;
                        I don't have a picture of we putting the sauce, but when it's browned on the four sides you wet all the sides with sauce and put back in the grill.
                        Since it has sugar, just a bit of time on the heat is sufficient. Take it off and it's ready to eat! &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        Here's a well made plate (not mine)
                        &lt;div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; max-width: 100%;"&gt;
                            &lt;img style="margin: 5px; max-width: 50%;" src="/images/culinaria/prato-decente.webp" alt=""&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;h3&gt;It was fine&lt;/h3&gt;
                        I think i don't like seafood that much. Idk, something in the flavor just don't click with me. &lt;br&gt;
                        It wasn't bad, but for me it isn't something i would go after to eat on a regular basis. &lt;br&gt;
                        The yakitori is great, will make at home eventually (still need a grill, a beetle hubcap will suffice) &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;

                        &lt;h3&gt;See ya next time o/&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;

                        Hi o/ &lt;br&gt;
                        Here i will post some thingies that i'm currently doing or thinking, will be very non-professional and &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; with translations 
                        (don't expect much from me)&lt;br&gt;
                        I'll use the main page as an art storage and portfolio&lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        So basically what i'll post here: &lt;br&gt;
                        • Extras (?) about the things in the main page. &lt;br&gt;
                        • Sometimes translations for training. &lt;br&gt;
                        • Gossip 💅 (rare)&lt;br&gt;
                        • Maybe css/js crimes (even rarer) &lt;br&gt;
                        • Announcements (the rarest)&lt;br&gt;
